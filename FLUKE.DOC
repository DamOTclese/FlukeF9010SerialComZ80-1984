FLUKE.LBR, written by Fredric L. Rice sometime in January 1984.

   Included within this  library is a file called FLUKE.COM and
FLUKE.MAC. I have offered the source code to  allow the user to
change values for modem operations required by his computer.

   The Fluke program is used only for the transfer and storrage
of Fluke 9010a microcode from computer to tester or from tester
to computer. This  allows the test teck.  to store his programs
on a disk rather than have to use  the tape cassett which is on
the F9010 but  proves to be  too slow for  in-house  testing of
computer equipment.

   I have found  that there are  a lot of people out  there who
use Fluke equipment, and a few that use the 9010a testing/fault
isolator. For  you people, this  program will mean that no more
tapes will be required and that old  revisions of test programs
can be stored and housed for  safe keeping.  Higher quantity of
programs on floppy is also a nice feature.

   BUT THE BEST PART:  After writing your test programs on your
computer with Word Star (tm), you can transfer the program, and
not have to use the Flukes keyboard.
